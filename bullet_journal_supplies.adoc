== What I tried

These didn’t end up working for me.

* Masking Stickers: http://a.co/2fGtfKF
* Pencil case 4 pk: http://a.co/5soUJIw (these were cute, but my kit outgrew them pretty quick)
* Northbooks 5x8 notebook:  http://a.co/5ZrCmux (I tried this because it was cheap, and hooboy is it. Also they sent me line grid instead of dot grid…)
